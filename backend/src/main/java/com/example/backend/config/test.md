1. Backend Implementation (Spring Boot):

Refresh Token Generation:
When a user logs in successfully, generate both an access token (JWT) and a refresh token.
The refresh token should be a long, random string with high entropy.
Store the refresh token securely in a database, associated with the user. Hash the refresh token before storing it.
Include the refresh token in an HttpOnly cookie.
/refresh Endpoint:
Create a new endpoint /api/auth/refresh that accepts the refresh token as a cookie.
Validate the refresh token:
Check if the refresh token exists in the database.
Verify that the refresh token is valid (not revoked or expired).
Verify that the user associated with the refresh token is still active.
If the refresh token is valid:
Generate a new access token (JWT) and a new refresh token.
Update the refresh token in the database (replace the old one with the new one).
Set the new access token and refresh token in HttpOnly cookies.
Return a success response.
If the refresh token is invalid:
Return an error response (e.g., 401 Unauthorized).
Token Revocation:
Implement a mechanism to revoke refresh tokens (e.g., when a user logs out, changes their password, or their account is compromised).
When a refresh token is revoked, remove it from the database.
Security Considerations:
Use a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., BCrypt or Argon2) to hash refresh tokens before storing them in the database.
Rotate refresh tokens to prevent replay attacks.
Implement safeguards against brute-force attacks on the /refresh endpoint.
Consider using a sliding expiration window for refresh tokens (i.e., the refresh token expires after a certain period of inactivity). 2. Frontend Implementation (Next.js):

API Client Interceptor:
Create an interceptor in your apiClient.ts to handle 401 Unauthorized errors.
When a 401 error is received, the interceptor should:
Check if the error is due to an expired access token.
If so, send a request to the /api/auth/refresh endpoint to obtain a new access token and refresh token.
If the refresh request is successful:
Retry the original request with the new access token.
If the refresh request fails:
Redirect the user to the login page.
Error Handling:
Handle errors from the /api/auth/refresh endpoint gracefully.
Display an error message to the user if the refresh request fails.
Cookie Management:
The frontend doesn't need to explicitly manage the accessToken or refreshToken cookies. The browser will automatically handle them based on the Set-Cookie headers received from the backend.
